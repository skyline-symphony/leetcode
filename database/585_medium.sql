-pid is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:
-pid is the policyholder's policy ID.
-tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.
-lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.
-lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.


Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

-have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
-are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).

Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.
